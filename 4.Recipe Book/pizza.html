        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110-115°F)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Your favorite pizza toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.</li>
            <li>Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C). Punch down the dough and divide it in half.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        </ol>
